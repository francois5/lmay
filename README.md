# LMAY Markup for AI in YAML

**LMAY** (LMAY Markup for AI in YAML) is a universal declarative standard designed to enable AI systems to quickly and accurately understand the structure and intent of complex codebases. Through simple, human-readable YAML files, LMAY creates a semantic map of your project, making it instantly accessible to AI programming assistants. This reduces computational costs, improves AI accuracy, and fosters better collaboration between developers and AI.

## Why LMAY?

- **Efficiency**: Reduces up to 90% of the tokens required for AI to understand your project, thereby lowering costs and speeding up responses.
- **Universality**: Compatible with all programming languages and frameworks, adaptable to any project.
- **Collaboration**: Establishes a common language between developers and AI, boosting productivity.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the whitepaper**: For an in-depth look at LMAY's architecture, specifications, and use cases, check out the [full whitepaper](./whitepaper.md).
